# Unyfy Demo Client

Showcase how Unyfy's client should interact with Seismic's matching engine. Documentation included in-line at `client-sample/client.ts`. 

We wrote this client so it may have minimal dependencies / setup steps. Running the below commands is all you need to execute the full order flow from constructing -> submitting -> crossing -> filling.
```
cd client-sample/
npm install
npm run dev
```
